## Brief Introduction

TalentTap is a lightweight job board built to connect employers with candidates quickly and accessibly. Employers can create, edit and manage job listings from a simple dashboard, while visitors can browse, filter and view full job details, contact employers via a built-in form, and apply where a contact method is provided. The project focuses on clean, mobile-responsive pages, semantic HTML for accessibility, and a small, testable Django backend to handle job posting, form submissions and notification emails.

## Notes

### AI-assisted development

Parts of the README content and some developer-facing notes (such as templates, section structure, and suggested deployment steps) were drafted with the assistance of AI tools. AI was used to:

- Generate concise documentation text (README sections and a project introduction)
- Summarise user-story driven features and prioritise checklist items
- Suggest deployment, testing, and accessibility reminders

All AI-generated outputs were reviewed, edited, and accepted by the project developer. The developer verified the correctness, adjusted technical details to match the implementation, and ensured no sensitive data or secrets were introduced.
