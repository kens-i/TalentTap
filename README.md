## Brief Introduction
TalentTap is a lightweight job board built to connect employers with candidates quickly and accessibly. Employers can create, edit and manage job listings from a simple dashboard, while visitors can browse, filter and view full job details, contact employers via a built-in form, and apply where a contact method is provided. The project focuses on clean, mobile-responsive pages, semantic HTML for accessibility, and a small, testable Django backend to handle job posting, form submissions and notification emails.
